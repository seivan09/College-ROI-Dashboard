Problem:
College costs are high, and it’s difficult to compare which schools offer the best return on investment (ROI).

Data:
Used the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard dataset, which includes earnings 10 years after enrollment, student debt, degree levels, and school types across all U.S. regions.

Methodology:
Built a full ETL pipeline in R using dplyr, janitor, and ggplot2 to clean and analyze data.
Created an interactive Shiny dashboard to visualize ROI by region, degree level, and school type.

Key Insights:
Public institutions tend to show higher ROI due to lower debt.
For-profit schools often have lower returns and higher debt loads.
ROI varies significantly by region and degree type.

Recommendations:
Use ROI metrics to guide education policy and help students make more informed choices about college affordability and long-term value.

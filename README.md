Goal: Built my first full data pipeline and interactive dashboard in R analyzing college ROI across the U.S.

Used U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard data to visualize: Earnings,student debt, ROI by region,degree level,and school type.

Designed an end-to-end ETL pipeline (extract, transform, load) to support data-driven policy insights.

Result: Delivered a fully deployable R dashboard showcasing ROI across diverse educational inputs nationwide.
